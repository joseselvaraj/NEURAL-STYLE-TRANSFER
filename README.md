# Task Title: NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER

# Task Summary:

To implement Neural Style Transfer (NST) using PyTorch to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another. The final output is a visually styled image, generated by optimizing a target image to minimize the difference in content and style features.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3.13

Libraries:

torch, torchvision – For deep learning and pretrained VGG19

PIL, tkinter – For image loading and GUI file selection

matplotlib, numpy – For plotting and image conversion

Tasks Completed:

Step	Task Description

	Implemented GUI image selection for content and style
	Loaded and resized both images (256×256) to improve processing speed
	Extracted features from a pretrained VGG19 network
	Computed content and style loss using feature maps
	Used PyTorch’s LBFGS optimizer to minimize total loss
	Saved the stylized image as output_styled.png after 50 iterations
	Resolved RuntimeError due to backpropagation over reused graph
	Ensured stable performance with minimal memory consumption

Results:

Successfully generated a stylized image by blending:

Content Image (structure)

Style Image (color and texture)

The model converged with decreasing total loss over 50 iterations.

Output image was saved and verified visually.

Output Example:

Output saved as: output_styled.png
